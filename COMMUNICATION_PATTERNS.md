# Communication Patterns

## Effective AI-Human Collaboration

### Zoom In/Zoom Out Framework
- **Zoom Out**: Maintain high-level perspective on goals and architecture
- **Zoom In**: Focus on implementation details when coding
- **Regular Perspective Shifting**: Alternate between views for alignment

### Communication Modes
- **Code Mode**: Implementation, debugging, refactoring
- **Architect Mode**: Planning, system design, technical vision
- **Ask Mode**: Information, explanations, clarifications
- **Debug Mode**: Issue diagnosis, error resolution
- **Explain Mode**: Breaking down complex concepts

## Prompt Engineering

### Effective Prompts
- Be specific about what you need
- Include relevant context
- Break complex requests into smaller steps
- Specify format or structure when needed

### Response Improvement
- Ask for clarification when confused
- Request different approaches to the same problem
- Ask for examples when explanation isn't clear
- Specify level of detail needed

## Project Management Communication

### Task Communication
- Clear start and end states
- Context about related components
- Dependencies and potential blockers
- Success criteria for completion

### Progress Updates
