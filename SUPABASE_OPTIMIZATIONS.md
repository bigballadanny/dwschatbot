## Overview

Supabase Edge Functions are serverless functions that run close to your users, providing low-latency responses. In the DWS Chatbot, they handle critical operations like:

- Processing chat messages (`gemini-chat`)
- Converting text to speech (`text-to-speech`)
- Converting speech to text (`speech-to-text`)
- Searching embeddings for knowledge retrieval (`search_embeddings`)
- Processing transcripts (`process-transcript`)

These functions impact both performance and user experience, making their optimization crucial.

## General Optimization Principles

### 1. Request/Response Optimization

- **Minimize payload sizes**: Trim unnecessary data from requests and responses
- **Compress large responses**: Use gzip or other compression when appropriate
- **Use binary formats**: When possible, use binary encoding instead of text/JSON
- **Stream large responses**: For large responses, use streaming to improve perceived performance

### 2. Caching Strategy

- **Implement multi-level caching**:
  - Client-side caching for frequently used responses
  - Edge function in-memory caching for fast responses
  - Database caching for persistent storage
- **Use appropriate TTL** (Time-To-Live) for different types of data
- **Add cache headers** to responses when appropriate
- **Implement cache invalidation** for time-sensitive data

### 3. Error Handling and Resilience

- **Add structured error handling** with clear error categories
- **Implement client-side retry logic** with exponential backoff
- **Add request IDs** for tracing and debugging
- **Include fallback mechanisms** for critical functions
- **Log errors systematically** for later analysis

### 4. Performance Monitoring

- **Track function execution times** for each phase
- **Monitor resource usage** (memory, CPU)
- **Implement custom metrics** for business KPIs
- **Set up alerts** for performance degradation
- **Create a performance dashboard** for visibility

## Function-Specific Optimizations

### gemini-chat Function

**Key improvements**:
- More efficient transcript truncation to reduce token usage
- Enhanced caching with TTL support
- Better error categorization and handling
- Support for message streaming

### text-to-speech Function

**Key improvements**:
- Response caching to reduce API calls
- Enhanced text processing for better speech quality
- Support for voice profiles and customization
- Audio chunking for handling long text

### speech-to-text Function

See detailed optimizations in [speech-to-text/optimizations.md](./supabase/functions/speech-to-text/optimizations.md)

**Key improvements**:
- Adaptive audio configuration for better recognition
- Domain-specific recognition for business terminology

2. Optimize edge cases and error scenarios
3. Fine-tune caching strategies based on usage patterns
4. Document optimization techniques for future reference

## Monitoring and Measurement

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Latency**: Time taken for each function to respond
   - Average response time
   - 95th percentile response time
   - Time to first byte (TTFB)

2. **Resource Usage**:
   - Memory consumption
   - CPU utilization
   - Execution duration

3. **Success Rates**:
   - Function success rate
   - Error rates by category
   - Client-side retry counts

4. **Business Impact**:
   - User satisfaction scores
   - Engagement duration
   - Completion rates for voice interactions

### Monitoring Implementation

Add the following code to each function to collect metrics:

```typescript
// Metrics collection for Supabase Edge Functions
interface FunctionMetrics {
  functionName: string;
  requestId: string;
  userId?: string;
  startTime: number;
  endTime?: number;
  duration?: number;
  success: boolean;
  errorType?: string;
  errorMessage?: string;
  cacheHit?: boolean;
  resourceUsage?: {
    memoryUsage?: number;
    cpuTime?: number;
  };
  customMetrics?: Record<string, any>;
}

// Usage at the start of the function
const metrics: FunctionMetrics = {
  functionName: 'function-name',
  requestId: crypto.randomUUID(),
  startTime: performance.now(),
  success: false
};

// Then at the end of the function
metrics.endTime = performance.now();
metrics.duration = metrics.endTime - metrics.startTime;
metrics.success = true;

// Log metrics
await supabase
  .from('function_metrics')
  .insert(metrics)
  .then(() => console.log(`Metrics logged for request ${metrics.requestId}`))
  .catch(e => console.error("Failed to log metrics:", e));
```

## Client Integration Guidelines

To properly integrate with the optimized Supabase functions, client-side code should:

1. **Implement proper retry logic** with exponential backoff
2. **Use client-side caching** for frequently accessed data
3. **Handle errors gracefully** with user-friendly messages
4. **Support streaming** for large responses
5. **Provide user feedback** during long-running operations
6. **Monitor client-side performance** for a complete picture

Example integration code is provided in each function's optimization document.

By implementing these optimizations, we expect to see:

- **Reduced API costs**: Through efficient token usage and caching
- **Faster response times**: Through optimized processing and caching
- **Improved reliability**: Through better error handling and retries
- **Enhanced user experience**: Through streaming and progressive loading
- **Better insights**: Through comprehensive monitoring

These improvements will make the DWS Chatbot more responsive, reliable, and cost-effective.
