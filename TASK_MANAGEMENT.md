## Task Organization

### Prioritization Framework
- **HIGH**: Critical path items that block other work or have immediate user impact
- **MEDIUM**: Important features that enhance functionality but aren't blocking
- **LOW**: Nice-to-have features, documentation, minor improvements

### Task Tracking Format
```
- [ ] Task description
  - Component: Where the task applies
  - Zoom-in details: Specific implementation notes
  - Dependencies: Any prerequisite tasks
```

### Task States
- **[ ]** = Not started
- **[/]** = In progress (with partial details)
- **[x]** = Completed (include date when possible)

## Workflow Patterns

### Sprint Planning
1. Review completed tasks and lessons learned
2. Prioritize backlog items based on current needs
3. Create time-boxed work chunks with clear deliverables
4. Plan checkpoints for complex features

### Progress Tracking
- Update task status as work progresses
- Move completed tasks to a separate section 
- Document any blockers or dependencies
- Add completion dates for tracking velocity

## Project Management Best Practices

- Break large features into smaller, focused tasks
- Always update documentation when completing tasks
- Maintain clear separation between in-progress work and backlog
- Regular task cleanup to prevent stagnant items
