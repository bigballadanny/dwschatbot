# SYNTHIOS Knowledge Base

## Core Principles

### First Principles Thinking
First Principles thinking, popularized by Elon Musk, involves breaking down complex problems into their fundamental truths and then reasoning up from there. Rather than reasoning by analogy (comparing to what has been done before), we start with the most fundamental truths we know and build solutions from the ground up.

**Application in our project:**
- Question assumptions about how M&A dashboards should work
- Identify the core value we're providing to users (understanding business acquisition materials)
- Build features that directly address these core needs rather than copying existing solutions

### Zoom In/Zoom Out Methodology
- **Zoom Out**: Understand the big picture, overall architecture, user journeys
- **Zoom In**: Focus on implementation details, optimizations, specific features
- Regularly alternate between these perspectives to maintain both cohesion and quality

### Intuitive User Experience
Create interfaces that feel natural and require minimal explanation, similar to the simplicity of Telegram or the innovation of Tesla's interfaces:
- Clear, consistent navigation
- Thoughtful information hierarchy
- Minimal cognitive load
- Progressive disclosure of complex features

## Project Overview

This project creates a user interface and dashboard for new users in the mergers and acquisition space to access and learn from Carl Allen's Deal Maker Society resources. Key components include:

1. **User-facing dashboard** for accessing and searching transcript content
2. **Admin analytics section** to track user engagement and identify popular topics
3. **War Room** for users to upload potential business documents for AI analysis
4. **Transcript management system** for organizing educational content

## Development Workflow

1. **Task Creation & Documentation**
   - New tasks are added to the knowledge base
   - Tasks are moved to CHANGELOG.md after completion
   - Every 5-7 prompts, conduct a "vibe session" to review and align

2. **Code Implementation Guidelines**
   - Modular components with focused responsibilities
   - Consistent naming conventions
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - Comments for complex logic
   - Optimize for readability and maintainability

3. **AI Implementation Strategy**
   - Use Gemini AI for complex analytical tasks (transcript analysis, business document review)
   - Keep frontend logic in React for better performance
   - Implement proper error handling for AI service failures

## Technical Architecture

### State Management
- React Context API for global state (authentication, user preferences)
- Local component state for UI-specific concerns
- Supabase for data persistence

### Data Flow Patterns
- Unidirectional data flow
- Custom hooks for data fetching and processing
- Proper error boundary implementation

### API Integration
- Supabase for backend storage and authentication
- Gemini API for AI-powered features
- Edge functions for secure API interactions

## Current Modules

### Transcript Management
The transcript management system allows admins to:
- Upload transcript files
- Auto-categorize content by source type
- Add and manage tags
- Fix transcript metadata
- Run diagnostics on transcript uploads

### Analytics Dashboard
Analytics dashboard for admins provides insights into:
- User engagement metrics
- Popular search queries
- Content gap analysis
- Usage patterns

### AI Chat Interface
AI-powered chat interface that:
- Leverages transcript content to answer user questions
- Provides relevant citations
- Supports voice interactions
- Maintains conversation context

### War Room (In Development)
Planning to implement:
- Document upload for business analysis
- AI-powered initial business assessment
- Key metrics extraction
- Comparative analysis tools

## File Structure Guidelines

- Maintain small, focused component files (under 200 lines where possible)
- Separate business logic into hooks and utilities
- Group related components in feature folders
- Extract types to dedicated type files

## Important Rules

1. **Knowledge Base Protection**:
   - Major structural changes require verification code: "S-Y-N-T-H-I-O-S"
   - Regularly update the knowledge base with new information
   - Move completed tasks to the CHANGELOG.md

2. **Code Quality**:
   - Refactor large files into smaller, more maintainable components
   - Think critically about requirements before implementing
   - Document complex logic and architectural decisions

3. **AI Usage**:
   - Use Gemini AI for appropriate analytical tasks
   - Balance AI usage with performance and cost considerations
   - Implement proper fallbacks for when AI services are unavailable

## Lessons Learned & Wins üèÜ

### Optimizations That Worked

## Future Innovations

1. **Enhanced War Room Capabilities**
   - Financial ratio analysis
   - Industry comparison tools
   - Due diligence checklist automation

2. **Advanced Learning Pathways**
   - Personalized content recommendations based on user interests
   - Learning progress tracking
   - Interactive exercises

3. **Community Features**
   - User discussion forums around specific topics
   - Expert Q&A integration
   - Peer networking opportunities

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Large Transcript Files
**Solution**: Implement pagination, search optimization, and content extraction

### Challenge: Maintaining Context Across Sessions
**Solution**: Persistent storage of user context and smart context summarization

### Challenge: Response Time for Complex Queries
**Solution**: Response caching, parallel processing, and optimistic UI updates
