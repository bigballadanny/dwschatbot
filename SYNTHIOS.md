# SYNTHIOS - Master System Documentation

## ðŸ”’ CORE PROTECTION PROTOCOL ðŸ”’

This system is fundamental to project integrity. Changes require:
1. Explicit user confirmation with passcode: "SYNTHIOS"
2. Version backup before structural changes
3. All task implementations must reference an approved task ID

## Documentation Structure

This repository uses a focused documentation approach with five key files:

1. **[WORKFLOW.md](./WORKFLOW.md)** - Core workflow processes, communication frameworks, and problem-solving protocols
2. **[TASKS.md](./TASKS.md)** - Active task tracking and backlog management
3. **[CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)** - Archive of completed tasks and system changes
4. **[STANDARDS.md](./STANDARDS.md)** - Coding, quality, and technical standards
5. **[REFERENCE.md](./REFERENCE.md)** - Technical reference documentation

## First Principles Framework

### Core Philosophy
We approach all problems using first principles thinking:
1. Question all assumptions and conventional approaches
2. Break down complex problems to fundamental truths
3. Rebuild solutions from these fundamental elements
4. Evaluate ideas on merit, not authority or convention

### Elon Musk's 5-Step Optimization Method
1. **Question requirements**: Remove unnecessary constraints
2. **Delete parts/processes**: Simplify ruthlessly
3. **Optimize remaining elements**: Only after simplification
4. **Accelerate cycle time**: Speed up development after optimization
5. **Automate**: Only automate already-simplified processes

## Task Management System

### Task Lifecycle
1. **Proposal**: Tasks must be clearly defined and added to TASKS.md
2. **Approval**: All tasks require explicit approval with "TASK APPROVAL: [TaskID]"
3. **Implementation**: Work references the approved task ID
4. **Verification**: Testing and validation against requirements
5. **Completion**: Move to CHANGELOG.md with completion date

### Task Structure
[ ] Task description [TASK-ID]
Component: Affected system component
Priority: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
Dependencies: List of prerequisite tasks
Acceptance Criteria: Clear conditions for completion

See [TASKS.md](./TASKS.md) for current active tasks and backlog.
