# Reference Documentation Standards

## Purpose

This document establishes guidelines for creating, maintaining, and utilizing reference documentation within our project. Reference documentation provides foundational knowledge about technologies, patterns, and best practices that should guide our implementation.

## Reference Documentation Structure

### Location
All reference documentation is stored in the `docs/reference/` directory.

### File Organization
- Each technology or pattern gets its own markdown file
- File naming convention: `technology-name-reference.md`
- Index file (`README.md`) in the reference directory lists all available documentation

### Content Structure
Each reference document should include:
1. **Overview**: Brief description of the technology/pattern
2. **Core Concepts**: Key ideas and principles
3. **Implementation Patterns**: Code examples and usage patterns
4. **Best Practices**: Recommended approaches
5. **Common Pitfalls**: Issues to avoid
6. **References**: Links to official documentation and resources

## Using Reference Documentation

### When to Consult
- Before implementing a feature using a specific technology
- When optimizing existing code
- When troubleshooting issues related to a specific technology
- When making architectural decisions

### Implementation Compliance
- All implementations should follow patterns described in reference documentation
- Deviations require clear justification and documentation
- When reference docs conflict with other requirements, seek clarification

### Referencing in Tasks
Tasks that involve specific technologies should reference the relevant documentation:
```
- [ ] Implement vector search optimization [TASK-ID]
  - Component: PGVector configuration
  - Reference: docs/reference/pgvector-reference.md
  - Acceptance Criteria: 30% improvement in query response time
```

## Current Reference Documentation

1. **LightRAG**: `docs/reference/lightrag-reference.md`
   - Documentation on our RAG framework implementation
   - Chunking strategies, search modes, and implementation patterns

2. **PGVector**: `docs/reference/pgvector-reference.md`
   - Vector database implementation and optimization
   - Query patterns, indexing strategies, and performance optimization

## Maintaining Reference Documentation

### Update Frequency
- Review and update reference documentation quarterly
- Update immediately when major version changes occur in referenced technologies
- Add new reference documentation when introducing new technologies

### Quality Standards
- All code examples must be tested and functional
- Document common errors and their resolutions
- Include performance implications of different approaches
- Provide concrete examples rather than abstract concepts

### Contribution Process
1. Create or update reference documentation
2. Peer review for accuracy and completeness
3. Merge into the documentation repository
4. Announce updates to the team

## Integration with Coding Standards

Reference documentation should align with and complement our project's coding standards. When implementing features:

1. First, consult relevant reference documentation
2. Apply project-specific coding standards
3. Follow patterns established in the reference documentation
4. Document any project-specific adaptations
