# Decision Making Framework

## Decision Models

### WRAP Framework (Heath & Heath)
1. **Widen Your Options**: Consider multiple alternatives
2. **Reality-Test Your Assumptions**: Look for evidence and counter-evidence
3. **Attain Distance**: Overcome short-term emotions
4. **Prepare to Be Wrong**: Consider how decisions might fail

### Weighted Decision Matrix
For complex decisions with multiple factors:
1. List all important factors
2. Assign weights to each factor (1-10)
3. Score each option against factors (1-10)
4. Multiply scores by weights
5. Sum weighted scores for each option

## Technical Decision Making

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
Document important architectural decisions:
- **Context**: The situation and problem
- **Decision**: The change being proposed
- **Status**: Proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded
- **Consequences**: Results of the decision, both positive and negative
- **Alternatives**: Other options considered

### Risk Assessment
Evaluate technical decisions based on:
- Performance impact
- Maintenance complexity
- Learning curve
- Future expandability
- Security implications
- Resource requirements

## Conflict Resolution

### Disagreement Resolution Process
1. Clearly state the different perspectives
2. Identify common ground and actual points of disagreement
3. Focus on interests, not positions
4. Generate multiple options before deciding
5. Use objective criteria for evaluation
6. Document the final decision and rationale

### Balancing Factors
- Short-term vs. long-term considerations
- Technical debt vs. delivery speed
- Innovation vs. stability
- Simplicity vs. flexibility
- User experience vs. development efficiency
