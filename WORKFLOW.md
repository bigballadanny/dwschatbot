# SYNTHIOS - Master Workflow System

## ðŸ”’ CORE PROTECTION PROTOCOL ðŸ”’

This system is fundamental to project integrity. Changes require:
1. Explicit user confirmation with passcode: "SYNTHIOS"
2. Version backup before structural changes
3. All task implementations must reference an approved task ID

## First Principles Framework

### Core Philosophy
We approach all problems using first principles thinking:
1. Question all assumptions and conventional approaches
2. Break down complex problems to fundamental truths
3. Rebuild solutions from these fundamental elements
4. Evaluate ideas on merit, not authority or convention

### Elon Musk's 5-Step Optimization Method
1. **Question requirements**: Remove unnecessary constraints
2. **Delete parts/processes**: Simplify ruthlessly
3. **Optimize remaining elements**: Only after simplification
4. **Accelerate cycle time**: Speed up development after optimization
5. **Automate**: Only automate already-simplified processes

## Task Management System

### Task Lifecycle
1. **Proposal**: Tasks must be clearly defined and added to TASKS.md
2. **Approval**: All tasks require explicit approval with "TASK APPROVAL: [TaskID]"
3. **Implementation**: Work references the approved task ID
4. **Verification**: Testing and validation against requirements
5. **Completion**: Move to CHANGELOG.md with completion date

### Task Structure
[ ] Task description [TASK-ID]
Component: Affected system component
Priority: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
Dependencies: List of prerequisite tasks
Acceptance Criteria: Clear conditions for completion

### Task Status Tracking
- **[ ]** = Not started
- **[/]** = In progress (with implementation notes)
- **[x]** = Completed (include date)

## Communication Framework

### Zoom In/Zoom Out Method
- Start each session with a "zoom out" to see the big picture
- "Zoom in" when implementing specific features
- Regularly shift perspective to maintain alignment

### Communication Modes
- **Code Mode**: Implementation, debugging, refactoring
- **Vibe Mode**: Planning, system design, technical vision
- **Ask Mode**: Information, explanations, clarifications
- **Debug Mode**: Issue diagnosis, error resolution
- **Explain Mode**: Breaking down complex concepts

## Resource Management

### Token Awareness
- Track approximate token usage for large tasks
- Break complex implementations into smaller chunks
- Prioritize critical path items when facing resource constraints
- Document progress clearly for continuity across sessions

### Continuity Protocol
When facing resource limitations:
1. Summarize current progress
2. Document next specific steps
3. Save intermediate work with clear markers
4. Create continuation points for seamless resumption

## Problem-Solving Protocol

### Root Cause Analysis
1. Identify symptoms with specific evidence
2. Formulate multiple hypotheses
3. Test each hypothesis systematically
4. Document findings for future reference
5. Implement solutions addressing root causes, not just symptoms

### Pivot Protocol
After 3 unsuccessful solution attempts:
1. Document failed approaches and learnings
2. Perform a complete perspective shift
3. Re-examine problem from first principles
4. Consider radical alternative approaches

## Code Excellence Standards

- Components under 200 lines
- Functions under 50 lines
- Proper TypeScript typing
- Comprehensive error handling
- Regular refactoring of complex modules

## Maintenance Discipline

- Move completed tasks to CHANGELOG.md after every 10 completions
- Regularly review and clean up dead code
- Update documentation with each significant change
- Regular system health checks using diagnostic tools

## Progress Metrics

- Track completion rate of high-priority tasks
- Monitor and document bug rates and resolution times
- Capture and analyze system performance metrics
- Document and review lessons learned regularly
