## 2. Modes
This project utilizes different operational modes to handle various aspects of development and interaction:

-   **Code Mode:** Responsible for writing, debugging, and refactoring code. Implements features based on plans and specifications. Handles tasks requiring direct file manipulation and execution of coding-related commands.
-   **Architect Mode:** Focuses on planning, system design, and defining project structure. Gathers requirements, creates technical plans, and outlines workflows. Ensures the overall technical vision is sound.
-   **Ask Mode:** Provides information, answers questions about software development, technology, and project specifics. Explains concepts and clarifies details.
-   **Debug Mode:** Specializes in diagnosing and resolving issues. Identifies root causes of bugs, analyzes errors, and proposes solutions.
-   **Boomerang Mode:** Orchestrates complex tasks by breaking them down and delegating sub-tasks to the most appropriate specialized modes. Manages the overall flow of multi-step operations.

## 3. Workflow & Tasks

### 3.1. Process
-   **Task Identification & Definition:** New tasks or requirements are identified and documented in the "Board" section below. Complex tasks should be broken down into smaller, manageable chunks.
-   **Prioritization:** Tasks are prioritized based on project goals and dependencies.
-   **Execution:** Tasks are assigned to or picked up by the appropriate mode (often Code mode for implementation). Focus on one task at a time, implementing small, targeted changes after analyzing the full scope.
-   **Review & Alignment:** Regular "vibe sessions" (every 5-7 prompts) should be conducted to review progress, align understanding, and update the task board.
-   **Completion:** Tasks are marked as complete (`[x]`) only after being fully tested and verified. Completed tasks are then moved to the "Log / Changelog" section. Add new observations or bugs found during development to the board.
-   **Philosophy:** Remember: Every challenge is an opportunity for elegant solutions! ðŸ’¡

## 5. Context & Guidelines

### 5.1. Principles
-   **First Principles Thinking:** Break down complex problems into fundamental truths and reason up from there. Question assumptions and build solutions from the ground up, focusing on core user value.
-   **Zoom In/Zoom Out Methodology:** Regularly alternate between the big picture (architecture, user journeys) and implementation details (optimizations, features) to maintain cohesion and quality.
-   **Intuitive User Experience:** Create interfaces that feel natural and require minimal explanation (clear navigation, thoughtful hierarchy, minimal cognitive load, progressive disclosure).

*Migration Source: `ARCHIVED_SYNTHIOS.md` (Core Principles)*

### 5.2. Architecture
-   **State Management:** React Context API for global state (auth, preferences), local state for UI concerns, Supabase for persistence.
-   **Data Flow:** Unidirectional data flow, custom hooks for fetching/processing, error boundaries.
-   **API Integration:** Supabase (backend/auth), Gemini API / Vertex AI (AI features), Edge functions (secure interactions).

*Migration Source: `ARCHIVED_SYNTHIOS.md` (Technical Architecture)*

### 5.3. Dev Guidelines
-   **Code Implementation:** Modular components, consistent naming, TypeScript, comments for complex logic, optimize for readability/maintainability.
-   **AI Strategy:** Use Gemini/Vertex AI for appropriate analytical tasks, balance with performance/cost, implement fallbacks.
-   **File Structure:** Small, focused components (<200 lines), separate logic (hooks/utils), group related components, dedicated type files.

*Migration Source: `ARCHIVED_SYNTHIOS.md` (Relevant sections)*

### 5.4. Lessons & Wins
-   **Key Wins:** Reduced load time (40%), improved chat UX, intuitive analytics, fixed critical persistence issues, resilient saving mechanism, schema compatibility layer.
-   **Optimizations/Lessons Applied:** Breaking tasks down, regular "vibe sessions", structured documentation, consistent types, user testing, defensive programming, robust fallbacks, comprehensive logging.
-   **Common Pitfalls to Avoid:** Overengineering, neglecting UX, forgetting documentation.
-   **UX Patterns:** Progressive disclosure, consistent feedback, accessibility.
