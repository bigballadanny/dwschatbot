# First Principles Thinking

## Core Concepts

### Definition
First principles thinking involves breaking down complex problems into basic elements and then reassembling them from the ground up. It's about understanding the fundamental truths or "first principles" rather than reasoning by analogy.

### Key Elements
1. **Question Assumptions**: Challenge conventional wisdom and established practices
2. **Identify Fundamentals**: Distill problems to their most basic truths
3. **Build Up**: Create new solutions from these fundamental building blocks
4. **Avoid Appeal to Authority**: Ideas should stand on their merit, not their source

## Application in Development

### Elon Musk's 5-Step Method
1. **Make requirements less dumb**: Question each requirement and remove those that don't make sense
2. **Try to delete parts/processes**: If you're not adding back at least 10% of what you removed, you didn't delete enough
3. **Simplify and optimize**: Only after steps 1 and 2
4. **Accelerate cycle time**: Speed up development cycles after simplification
5. **Automate**: Only automate what's been simplified, not complex processes

### First Principles Questions
- "What problem are we actually trying to solve?"
- "Why do we believe the current approach works?"
- "What are the fundamental truths in this domain?"
- "If we started from scratch, what would we build?"
- "What constraints are real vs. assumed?"

## Implementation Strategies

### Breaking Down Problems
1. Identify the problem clearly
2. Question all assumptions
3. Determine fundamental truths
4. Create new solutions from first principles
5. Test and refine based on feedback

### Overcoming Cognitive Biases
- **Confirmation Bias**: Actively seek disconfirming evidence
- **Anchoring**: Reset expectations regularly
- **Authority Bias**: Evaluate ideas independent of their source
- **Status Quo Bias**: Question why things are done a certain way
