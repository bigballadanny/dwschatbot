- Create documentation framework
- Implement basic logging and monitoring

## Key Wins & Lessons üèÜ

### Wins
- Established modular architecture separating UI, core logic, and integrations
- Created minimal but functional RAG pipeline with clear extension points
- Implemented Streamlit UI for both chat and ingestion workflows
- Removed unnecessary dependencies on external Python backend service
- Simplified environment management and processing pipeline
- Developed comprehensive diagnostic tools for transcript management

### Lessons Applied
- Focusing on core functionality first ensures quicker time to value
- Regular documentation updates improve team alignment
- Testing from the start prevents technical debt
- Smaller, focused components improve maintainability
- Type definitions are crucial for complex system integration
