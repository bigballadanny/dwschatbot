### v0.1.1 (2025-04-30)
- Replaced mem0 with PGVector in Supabase
- Implemented feedback mechanism for continuous improvement
- Fixed environment variable management
- Added basic logging and monitoring

### v0.1.0 (2025-04-25)
- Initial project setup and documentation

### Core Functionality
- Set up basic Streamlit interface
- Implement RAG pipeline with OpenAI integration
- Create Supabase connection for metadata storage
- Set up mem0 for vector embeddings
- Implement basic document ingestion workflow
- Restore Lovable-compatible Streamlit app structure
- Add core LightRAG modules and ingestion pipeline
- Implement requirements.txt with only essential dependencies
- Add unit tests and /tests directory
- Add Supabase and mem0 integration stubs
- Implement Ingestion UI in Streamlit app

### Infrastructure
- Configure basic deployment workflow
- Set up environment variable management
- Create documentation framework
- Implement basic logging and monitoring

## Key Wins & Lessons üèÜ

### Wins
- Established modular architecture separating UI, core logic, and integrations
- Created minimal but functional RAG pipeline with clear extension points
- Implemented Streamlit UI for both chat and ingestion workflows
- Removed unnecessary dependencies on external Python backend service
- Simplified environment management and processing pipeline
- Developed comprehensive diagnostic tools for transcript management

### Lessons Applied
- Focusing on core functionality first ensures quicker time to value
- Regular documentation updates improve team alignment
- Testing from the start prevents technical debt
- Smaller, focused components improve maintainability
- Type definitions are crucial for complex system integration

## Current Priorities & Technical Debt

### Critical Issues
- Storage path standardization: Fix inconsistency in file_path handling across system
- Content extraction from storage: Ensure all transcripts with file_path have content extracted
- Edge function communication: Fix communication between trigger-processing and process-transcript

### High Priority Tasks
- Implement hierarchical document chunking for better context preservation
- Add source citation functionality with proper links to original content
- Optimize embedding generation service for better performance
- Add conversation history sidebar and feedback UI components

### Technical Debt
- Refactor large diagnostic utility files into smaller, focused components
- Consolidate duplicate code in transcript processing logic
- Improve error handling and retry mechanisms for edge functions
- Standardize logging format across edge functions for better debugging
