## Key Wins & Lessons üèÜ

### Wins
- Established modular architecture separating UI, core logic, and integrations
- Created minimal but functional RAG pipeline with clear extension points
- Implemented Streamlit UI for both chat and ingestion workflows
- Removed unnecessary dependencies on external Python backend service
- Simplified environment management and processing pipeline
- Developed comprehensive diagnostic tools for transcript management
- Fixed build errors and typescript issues for better code quality

### Lessons Applied
- Focusing on core functionality first ensures quicker time to value
- Regular documentation updates improve team alignment
- Testing from the start prevents technical debt
- Smaller, focused components improve maintainability
- Type definitions are crucial for complex system integration
- Proper type handling between Supabase and frontend is essential

## Current Priorities & Technical Debt

### Critical Issues
- Storage path standardization: Fixed inconsistency in file_path handling across system
- Content extraction from storage: Implemented automatic extraction for transcripts with file_path
- Edge function communication: Fixed communication between trigger-processing and process-transcript
- Type safety: Fixed type inconsistencies between Supabase Json and TypeScript Record types

### High Priority Tasks
- Implemented hierarchical document chunking for better context preservation
- Added source citation functionality with proper links to original content
- Optimized embedding generation service for better performance
- Added conversation history sidebar and feedback UI components

### Technical Debt
