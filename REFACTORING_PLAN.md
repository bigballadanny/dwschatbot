1. Keep component files under 200 lines of code
2. Extract business logic into custom hooks
3. Separate UI components from data fetching logic
4. Use composition over inheritance
5. Standardize toast and notification patterns
6. Implement consistent error handling
7. Use TypeScript types rigorously
