## Refactoring Plan & Progress

### Phase 1: Fix Type Issues (VERIFICATION PENDING)
- [ ] Fix the "Type instantiation is excessively deep" error in messageUtils.ts
- [ ] Refactor message type definitions to avoid circular dependencies
- [ ] Update component imports to use the centralized types
- [ ] Verify all message-related code is using the proper types
- [ ] **Collaborative Verification Required**: Confirm no remaining type errors

### Phase 2: Consolidate Redundant Hooks (PREPARATION)
- [ ] Thoroughly analyze useChatController and useChatMessages
- [ ] Identify overlapping functionalities
- [ ] Plan consolidation strategy
- [ ] Prepare for potential refactoring of audio handling hooks

### Phase 3: Backend and Type System Deep Dive
- [ ] Investigate potential misalignments between frontend types and Supabase database schema
- [ ] Review message and conversation data flow
- [ ] Identify potential sources of type complexity
- [ ] Explore database schema implications on type definitions

### Phase 4: Simplify Voice and Audio Functionality
- [ ] Review current voice and audio implementation
- [ ] Identify areas of complexity
- [ ] Plan simplified, more maintainable approach

## Collaboration Guidelines
- No phase will be marked as "COMPLETED" without:
  1. Thorough code review
  2. Absence of build and runtime errors
  3. Mutual confirmation of implementation quality
- Prioritize incremental, verifiable improvements
- Maintain open communication about implementation challenges

## Current Focus
- Resolving type instantiation depth issues
- Preparing for hook consolidation
- Exploring backend-frontend type alignment
