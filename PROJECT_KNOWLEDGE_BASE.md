## Refactoring Plan & Progress

### Phase 1: Fix Type Issues (IN PROGRESS)
- [x] Fix the "Type instantiation is excessively deep" error in messageUtils.ts
- [x] Created dbMessageToUiMessage utility function to align with database schema
- [x] Simplified type definitions and conversion logic
- [x] Updated useMessages hook to use the new utility function
- [x] Added explicit DbMessage interface to prevent deep instantiation errors
- [ ] **Collaborative Verification Required**: Confirm no remaining type errors

### Phase 2: Consolidate Redundant Hooks (PREPARATION)
- [ ] Thoroughly analyze useChatController and useChatMessages
- [ ] Identify overlapping functionalities
- [ ] Plan consolidation strategy
- [ ] Prepare for potential refactoring of audio handling hooks

### Phase 3: Backend and Type System Alignment
- [x] Investigated alignment between frontend types and Supabase database schema
- [x] Identified that messages in the database have metadata field for source and citation
- [x] Created proper data transformation between DB and UI formats
- [ ] Ensure consistent data flow throughout the application
- [ ] Identify any remaining type complexity issues

### Phase 4: Simplify Voice and Audio Functionality
- [ ] Review current voice and audio implementation
- [ ] Identify areas of complexity
- [ ] Plan simplified, more maintainable approach

## Collaboration Guidelines
- No phase will be marked as "COMPLETED" without:
  1. Thorough code review
  2. Absence of build and runtime errors
  3. Mutual confirmation of implementation quality
- Prioritize incremental, verifiable improvements
- Maintain open communication about implementation challenges

## Current Focus
- Completing type system alignment
- Testing the fixes for the type instantiation error
- Preparing for hook consolidation
