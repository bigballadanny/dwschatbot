- [x] Identified that messages in the database have metadata field for source and citation
- [x] Created proper data transformation between DB and UI formats
- [x] Ensured consistent data flow throughout the application
- [x] Fixed remaining type complexity issues

### Phase 4: UI Improvements (IN PROGRESS)

## Current Focus
- Fixing voice/audio functionality issues to prevent echo and ensure pause button works
- Investigating sidebar UI issues with duplicate elements that cause layout shift
- Improving message bubble design and animations
- Refactoring audio handling to prevent memory leaks and ensure reliable operation

## Identified Issues
- Voice responses have an echo effect (audio playing twice)
- Pause button not working properly for voice playback
- UI issues with dual sidebars causing layout shift
- Empty space in the UI that needs to be addressed
- MessageList scrolling needs further optimization

## Collaboration Guidelines
- No phase will be marked as "COMPLETED" without:
  1. Thorough code review
  2. Absence of build and runtime errors
  3. Mutual confirmation of implementation quality
- Prioritize incremental, verifiable improvements
- Maintain open communication about implementation challenges
