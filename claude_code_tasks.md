# Claude Code Tasks

## 🚀 Current Status (Updated: 2025-05-22)

### ✅ Deployed by Claude Desktop:
1. **SQL Functions**:
   - `search_chunks` function - DEPLOYED ✅
   - pg_trgm extension - INSTALLED ✅
   - Text search index - CREATED ✅

2. **Edge Functions**:
   - `process-transcript` - DEPLOYED (v29) ✅
   - `ai-chat` - PENDING DEPLOYMENT 🔧

### 📋 Immediate Tasks for Claude Code:

#### 1. Test the Reprocessing UI
- Navigate to the Transcripts page
- Verify the "Reprocess All Transcripts" button appears
- Test processing a single transcript first
- Then test the batch processing

#### 2. Deploy ai-chat Function
Since Claude Desktop is handling deployments:
- The RAG integration in ai-chat looks good
- Deployment will be handled by Claude Desktop

#### 3. Create Test Script
Create a comprehensive test script at `test_rag_system.js` that:
- Tests transcript processing
- Tests chunk search functionality  
- Tests the full RAG pipeline
- Provides clear pass/fail indicators

### 🗄️ Database Status:
- **Transcripts**: 120 total (119 with content, 0 processed)
- **Chunks**: 0 (ready for processing)
- **Project ID**: bfscrjrjwbzpldamcrbz (DMWS AI)

### 🎯 Next Steps After Deployment:
1. Process all 120 transcripts via UI
2. Run test script to verify functionality
3. Test chat with M&A-specific questions

### 📝 Notes:
- Text-based search is sufficient for M&A content
- No embeddings needed initially (saves cost)
- Hierarchical chunking preserves context well
