# Testing Plan

This document outlines the testing strategy for our RAG system.

## Testing Goals

- Verify the correct functioning of the chunking algorithms
- Test the embedding and vector search capabilities
- Validate the RAG pipeline end-to-end
- Ensure the feedback mechanism improves search results over time

## Test Types

### Unit Tests

- **Chunking Tests**: Verify various chunking strategies (sentence, paragraph, section) with different text formats
- **Vector Storage Tests**: Test the PGVector client's ability to store and retrieve embeddings
- **Feedback Integration Tests**: Validate that feedback properly affects relevance scores

### Integration Tests

- **Full Pipeline Tests**: Test the entire RAG pipeline from document ingestion to query response
- **Supabase Integration**: Verify proper integration with Supabase for storage and retrieval

### Manual Tests

- **Upload a Transcript**: Test the transcript upload functionality
- **Query Relevance**: Manually verify query results for relevance
- **Feedback System**: Test providing feedback and observing improvements

## Test Procedure for Transcript Processing

1. **Preparation**:
   - Prepare a set of sample transcripts with varied content and lengths
   - Define expected chunks and embeddings for validation

2. **Document Ingestion Test**:
   - Upload a transcript through the UI
   - Verify the document is properly chunked
   - Check that embeddings are generated and stored correctly

3. **Query Testing**:
   - Submit a series of predefined queries related to the transcript content
   - Evaluate response relevance and accuracy
   - Record baseline performance metrics

4. **Feedback Loop Testing**:
   - Provide positive feedback for relevant results
   - Provide negative feedback for irrelevant results
   - Submit the same queries again and verify improved results

5. **Performance Testing**:
   - Measure response times under different load conditions
   - Evaluate system performance with increasing document volumes

## Test Data Management

- Create a dedicated `test_data` directory with sample transcripts
- Include expected results for automated validation
- Track test metrics over time to measure system improvement

## Continuous Testing Strategy

- Implement automated tests as part of the CI/CD pipeline
- Run regression tests after significant changes to the chunking or embedding algorithms
- Periodically benchmark the system against baseline performance metrics
