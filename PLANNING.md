# Project Planning

## Vision
Create a robust, maintainable chatbot with RAG capabilities that can be easily deployed on Lovable, providing contextual responses based on structured and unstructured data.

## Goals
1. Provide accurate, context-aware responses to user queries
2. Maintain clear separation of concerns for easy extensibility
3. Ensure high test coverage and code quality
4. Support incremental deployment and feature addition
5. Optimize for both performance and maintainability

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: Streamlit for rapid UI development
- **Backend**: Python-based API endpoints
- **Data Storage**: 
  - Supabase for structured data and metadata
  - mem0 for vector embeddings and semantic search
- **RAG Components**:
  - Document processing pipeline
  - Embedding generation and retrieval
  - Context assembly and prompt construction
  - Response generation with LLM integration

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETE)
- Basic chat interface
- Initial RAG implementation
- Supabase integration

### Phase 2: Enhanced Retrieval (IN PROGRESS)
- Improved context selection
- Multi-document support
- Query transformation and expansion

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (PLANNED)
- User preference tracking
- Conversation history integration
- Response customization options

### Phase 4: Optimization (PLANNED)
- Performance tuning
- Cost optimization
- Metrics and monitoring

## Integration Points
- OpenAI API for embeddings and completions
- Supabase for structured data storage
- mem0 for vector operations
- Lovable platform for deployment

## Success Metrics
- Response accuracy (measured through user feedback)
- System performance (latency, throughput)
- Code maintainability (test coverage, documentation quality)
- User satisfaction (engagement metrics, explicit feedback)
