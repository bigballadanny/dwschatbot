# Project Planning

## Overview & Goals
This project creates a user interface and dashboard for new users in the mergers and acquisition space to access and learn from Carl Allen's Deal Maker Society resources.

### Key Components
- User-facing dashboard for accessing and searching transcript content
- Admin analytics section to track user engagement and identify popular topics
- War Room for users to upload potential business documents for AI analysis
- Transcript management system for organizing educational content

## Principles & Methodologies
- **First Principles Thinking:** Break down complex problems into fundamental truths and reason up from there. Question assumptions and build solutions from the ground up, focusing on core user value.
- **Elon Musk's 5-Step Algorithm:**
  1. Make the requirements less dumb
  2. Delete any part or process you can
  3. Simplify and optimize
  4. Accelerate cycle time
  5. Automate (only after optimizing)
- **Zoom In/Zoom Out Methodology:** Alternate between big-picture architecture and implementation details.
- **Intuitive User Experience:** Prioritize natural, easy-to-use interfaces.

## Vision & Strategy
- Extract high-value, actionable insights ("golden nuggets") from transcript content
- Make insights searchable and contextually available during user conversations
- Create a knowledge base of practical business acquisition strategies
- Provide users with immediate access to the most valuable content

## Project Phases
- **Phase 1:** Set up all MCP servers and test connections
- **Phase 2:** Implement user dashboard and transcript search
- **Phase 3:** Build admin analytics and War Room features
- **Phase 4:** Optimize, automate, and scale
