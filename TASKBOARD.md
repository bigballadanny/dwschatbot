## Process Guidelines

### Task Management
- Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable chunks
- Don't mark tasks as complete until fully tested and verified
- Add new observations to this list when discovered
- Move completed tasks (5+ items) to CHANGELOG.md

### Development Approach
- Focus on one task at a time
- Implement small, targeted changes
- Analyze the full scope before making changes
- Conduct regular "vibe sessions" to review and align on progress
- Remember: Every challenge is an opportunity for elegant solutions! ðŸ’¡

## Protection Protocol
- Major structural changes require verification code
- Document wins and progress to maintain momentum
- Review this file at the start of each "vibe session"
